  text: "<p>Age of Enlightenment</p>\
  <p>The period also became known as the Age of Enlightenment for the radical ideas set forth in social\
   and political areas of life. After the renaissance and humanism of the early-modern period, people\
    began to ask themselves, ”what does it mean to be a human being?” and ”what rights do human beings have?”\
     Most of the writing of this time attempts to answer these questions in all aspects of human life.\
      For example, in religious life, people sought to understand the question of authority: does the established\
       church control spiritual thinking or must people determine spiritual matters themselves? Since many looked\
        to the classical philosophy of Greece and Rome for answers on issues of governance and authority, the period\
         also became known as the Neoclassical period. As people focused on the definition of basic human rights,\
          they became willing to fight against established authorities to obtain those rights.</p> \
            <p>Age of Restoration and Revolution</p> \
            <p>The year 1660 marked the beginning of what is known as ”the long eighteenth century,”\
             when Charles II returned from exile as the English monarch after twenty years of parliamentary rule.\
              The English people were the first to attempt a commonwealth republic that eventually fell apart under\
               the strain of civil war. The American colonies staged their revolution in 1776, culminating in their\
                independence from British monarchical rule. The French followed, beginning in 1789 with the storming\
                 of the Bastille in Paris and ending with the execution of King Louis XVI and Queen Marie Antoinette by guillotine in 1793.</p>\
                 <p>The successful revolutions against some of the most powerful monarchies of Europe spawned similar revolts against tyranny\
                  all over the world as people began to yearn for freedom.</p> ",
